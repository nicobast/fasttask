# fasttask - data preprocessing and analysis of fasttask data in neurodevelopmental disorders - <a href="[url](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2021.04.010)">publication</a>: 

INFO: the FASTTASK is a speeded visuospatial cognitive task. We concurrently recorded eye-tracking data including pupillometry
during the task with a Tobii X30.

- Data has been assessed as part of the EU funded Innovative Training Network MiND (grant number 82600321)
- Data are available upon request from the primary author (nico.bast@kgu.de)
- Data processing requires R 3.6 or higher. Required packages are outlined within scripts

#project contains three files:
1. BastBoxhoorn2020_fasttask_data_processing.R - data preprocessing according to established standards - see in script commenting
2. BastBoxhoorn2020_fasttask_data_analysis.Rmd - data analysis as R markdown - outputs all results including tables and figures
3. BastBoxhoorn2020_fasttask_power_simulation.R - power simulation based on observed random effect variance
